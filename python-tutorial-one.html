                First we will start with the print command. print() will tell the computer to display
                what ever is inside of the brackets. It is important to put quotes around text. You can use single quotes '', or double quotes "",
                but the computer will not be able to read your command if the same block of text uses one of each. If you would like to include
                a quotation mark or apostrophe, you must put a backslash \ before the quote so that the computer knows that this doesn't mean
                the end of your text block. If you ever want python to treat a character differently in text you normally use a backslash. Examples
                of things that use this are \t for a tab and a \n for a new line. To download python go to <a href="https://www.python.org/downloads/">python.org.</a>
				Next download the latest version of Python 3. if you download python 2.7 this code will give you errors. To start coding, open the
				IDLE window and make a new file. 
                <pre class="language-python"><code>
print("Hello World!\nThis is line 2")
                </code></pre>
		<pre class="language-python"><code>
Hello World!
This is line 2
                </code></pre>

            <h4 style="text-align: center">Lesson 2: Variables</h4><br>
            <p style="line-height: 2">
                For all programming languages, variable are esential. In python a variable called variable with the value 5 would be coded as
				variable = 5. Variables will store the value you set and when the variable name is used, accesses the value. For text you still
				have to include quotes. The reason is because otherwilse, it will think you are referring to a variable. An example of a variable
				use would be hello = "Hello, How are you?" and then print(hello). This will result in Hello, How are you? Variables can be strings,
				which is the programming name for a string of text, a number, true or false, which are called booleans. There are other ways variables
				can be used, but I will not be covering those. Variable names should be lowercase letters and underscores, otherwise the computer may have
				trouble interpreting it. += allows number variables to add the number on the right side instead of reset to it. For strings, it concatenates 
				them adding the line of text on the end of the already set variable. -= does the opposite, but only works for numbers. Variables can be set based
				on their old value or on other variables. Another helpful thing is to change what type of variable something is. To  convert to an integer or int you use int().
				For converting to strings it is str() and for decimals, called floats, it is float(). This is useful for print() as you cannot print an integer and string together.

                This is an example of variable usage:
                <pre class="language-python"><code>
text = "The number is "
number = 2
number += number
text_number = str(number)
text += text_number
print(text)

The number is 4

            </p>
        </div>

            <p style="line-height: 2">
				For getting a user input you use input(). Strings or a string variable
				can be put in the brackets. This will produce the text and then give
				the user an opportunity to type. A user input is always a string and is stored with
				a variable. If you would like the user input to be a number you can use int() or float()
				Adding is +, subtraction is -, multiplication is *, division is / and ** is to the power of
				something.
                <pre class="language-html"><code>
                user = input("pick the first number to add")
                number = int(user)
                user_second = input("pick the second number to add")
                second_number = int(user_second)
                result = user + user_second
                print(user)
                </code></pre>
